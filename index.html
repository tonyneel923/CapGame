  <!-- NOTE TO READERS
       We were getting an endless loop on game reset in desktop mode.
       I added a line to the updateBlocks() method to fix this.
       Basically, it hides the block that the ball is currently overlapping
       to prevent the game over state from occurring over and over again.
